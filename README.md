# Advanced_Coursera_Cap
Repository for the Advanced Data Science Capstone for IBM Coursera Course. The goal of the project was to find a use case, and a dataset, and apply machine learning techniques to it. The machine learning algorithm must be at least one deep learning and one non deep learning model. After creating the features for the model one more iteration is required and tested to see the differences. In this case I decided to do PCA on the 51 sensor readings and reduce them to 25 dimensions. In the end the final deliverables is a github repository with the key notebooks, an Architectural Decisions Document, and a youtube video with presentations to two different audiences, stakeholders and data science cohorts.
